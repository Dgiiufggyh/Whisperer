Whisperer lets you generate subtitles for any kind of video/audio files.

It uses OpenAI's whisper, it runs as many instances simultaneously as your GPU's memory allows.

Update: now uses [https://github.com/Const-me/Whisper](https://github.com/Const-me/Whisper) GPU enabled whispercpp, thanks to Kosta for this major speed improvement!

You will need the models from here: [http://198.100.146.225/Downloads/whisper-modes/](http://198.100.146.225/Downloads/whisper-modes/)

Requires ffmpeg on your path, not included.
