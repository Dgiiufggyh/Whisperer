Whisperer lets you generate subtitles for any kind of video/audio files.

It uses OpenAI's whisper, it runs as many instances simultaneously as your Nvidia GPU's memory allows.

Update: now uses https://github.com/Const-me/Whisper GPU enabled whispercpp, thanks to Kosta for this major speed improvement!

You will need the models from here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main

Requires ffmpeg on your path, not included.
